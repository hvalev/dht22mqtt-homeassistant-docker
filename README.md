This docker container enables you to use the DHT11, DHT22 or AM2302 temperature and humidity sensors on a GPIO enabled device such as raspberry pi. The container features a robust scheme to detect outliers and filter data in real-time. Additionally, this container can communicate with an MQTT broker and relay the sensors' values and integrates with home assistants' [discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/) protocol. Discovery will automatically detect the sensor and make it available for visualizations, automations, etc.

## How to run it
The following docker run command or docker-compose service will get you up and running with the minimal configuration.
```bash
docker run --device=/dev/gpiomem:/dev/gpiomem -e topic=zigbee2mqtt -e device_id=dht22 -e broker=192.168.X.X -e pin=4 hvalev/dht22mqtt-homeassistant
```
```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  dht22mqtt:
    image: hvalev/dht22mqtt-homeassistant
    container_name: dht22mqtt
    devices:
      - /dev/gpiomem:/dev/gpiomem
    environment:
      - topic=zigbee2mqtt
      - device_id=dht22
      - broker=192.168.X.X
      - pin=4
```
```/dev/gpiomem:/dev/gpiomem``` is required to access the GPIO and communicate with your DHT22 sensor. If it doesn't work, you can try to run the container in privileged mode ```privileged:true```.

## Parameters
The container offers the following configurable environment variables:</br>
| Parameter | Possible values | Description | Default |
| --------- | --------------- | ----------- | ------- |
| ```topic``` |  | MQTT topic to submit to. | ```zigbee2mqtt```  |
| ```device_id``` |  | Unique identifier for the device. *If you have multiple, you could use something like ```bedroom_dht22```.* | ```dht22``` |
| ```broker``` |  | MQTT broker ip address. | ```192.168.1.10``` |
| ```username``` |  | MQTT username. | `None` |
| ```password``` |  | MQTT password. | `None` |
| ```pin``` |  | GPIO data pin your sensor is hooked up to. | ```4``` |
| ```poll``` |  | Sampling rate in seconds. Recommended is the range between 2 to 30 seconds. Further information: [*DHT11/DHT22/AM2302 spec sheet.*](https://lastminuteengineers.com/dht11-dht22-arduino-tutorial/) | ```2``` |
| ```device_type``` | ```dht11``` or ```dht22``` | Sensor type. ```dht22``` also also works for AM2302 | ```dht22``` |
| ```unit``` | ```C``` or ```F``` | Measurement unit for temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit. | ```C``` |
| ```mqtt_chatter``` | ```essential\|ha\|full``` | Controls how much information is relayed over to the MQTT broker. Possible ***non-mutually exclusive*** values are: ```essential``` - enables basic MQTT communications required to connect and transmit data to the zigbee broker; ```ha``` enables home assistant discovery protocol; ```full``` enables sending information about the outlier detection algorithm internals over to the MQTT broker. | ```essential\|ha``` |
| ```logging``` | ```log2stdout\|log2file``` | Logging strategy. Possible ***non-mutually exclusive*** values are: ```log2stdout``` - forwards logs to stdout, inspectable through ```docker logs dht22mqtt``` and ```log2file``` which logs temperature and humidity readings to files timestamped at containers' start. | ```none``` |
| ```filtering``` | ```enabled``` or ```none``` | Enables outlier filtering. Disabling this setting will transmit the raw temperature and humidity values to MQTT and(or) the log. | ```enabled``` |
----------------------------------

*If you end up using ```log2file```, make sure to add this volume in your docker run or docker-compose commands ```- ~/yourfolderpath:/log``` to be able to access the logs from your host os.* </br> 

*If you want to run this container to simply record values to files with no MQTT integration, you need to explicitly set ```mqtt_chatter``` to a blank string. In that case, you can also omit all MQTT related parameters from your docker run or compose configurations.* </br>

*If you're using this container for multiple sensors on the same or different devices which, however, connect to the same mqtt network, you need to explicitly pick a unique ```device_id``` for each. Otherwise, identically named devices will boot each other off the network each time they transmit a reading.*

## Connecting your sensor 
To connect your sensor you can look at the following pinout. Typically each sensor needs to be connected to a power, ground and data pin. The data pin needs to be indicated in the ```pin``` parameter in order to read the sensor readings.

## Outlier detection scheme
To detect outliers, I'm using the [68–95–99.7 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule), where a reading is considered to be an outlier when it lies beyond 3 standard deviations from the mean.
In order to have a scheme, which is adaptive to rapid changes, I'm using two [FILO](https://everythingcomputerscience.com/discrete_mathematics/Stacks_and_Queues.html) stacks which store the last 10 valid readings for temperature and humidity respectively. When receiving a new reading, a mean and standard deviation are computed for the values in the stack and then subsequently used to detect whether this new reading is valid or an outlier. This allows the algorithm to adapt to gradual changes in sensor readings. Valid readings are added to the stack only if they are unique to the elements contained in the stack. This is done to prevent the stack from homogenizing and ensures that the standard deviation will never be 0. 

A weakness in the design is the initiation phase, when the stack is not fully populated or when multiple consecutive readings are outliers. To remedy this, the algorithm keeps track of successive outlier detections and flushes the stack when 3 such readings are detected. This prevents the stack from fitting on outliers if we presume that we get abnormal values less than half the time. Then again, perhaps the temperature really is 97°C.

Most of the time, outliers for temperature and humidity occur simultaneously.
As such a conservative approach is implemented, where only non-outliers for both temperature and humidity and forwarded. The following plots depict the temperature and humidity values at different sampling rates, where the first plot represents the original data and subsequent ones - simulating sparser sampling frequencies. The black vertical lines signify when the stack has been flushed.

## Visualize your own data
If you'd like visualize and check your own data (provided you have used the ```-logging=log2file``` option) to perhaps tweak the sampling rate (or stack size, if you're building it yourself), you can take a look at the ```dht22mqtt_visualize.py``` script. As long as you change the filename to your own, it will plot your data at the original sampling rate and simulate sparser ones for comparison.
